    "Disease mapping concerns the study of disease risk over a map of geographical regions.\n",
    "For an areal map of $I$ regions, the outcome $y_i$ is the number of cases of a given disease in region $i$. For a rare disease, a Poisson model is assumed, $y_i | {\\theta}_i \\sim Po({\\theta}_i)$ with mean ${\\theta}_i = E_i * r_i$, where $E_i$ is the expected cases count for the disease and $r_i$ is the relative risk.  Relative risk values above 1 indicate higher risk associated living a region. The relative risk can be modelled in terms of the effect of a covariates X as $log(r_i) = \\alpha + \\beta * x_i + {re}_i$; $\\alpha$ is the baseline log risk, $\\beta$ is the effect of the covariates, and ${re}_i$ is a random effect capturing extra Poisson variability possibly due to unobserved risk factors.\n",

    "- $\\theta$, an ordinary random effects component which accounts for non-spatial heterogeneity.\n",
